/**
 * The API/MCP activity log: who called, what they called, whether the
 * security gates let it through, what came back. Written on essentially
 * every authenticated request (src/middlewares/authentication.js's onResponse
 * hook; src/plugins/mcp.js for the MCP surface).
 *
 * One row per request on both surfaces. Which MCP tool an agent called is not
 * a second row: the permission gate reports every call
 * (src/mcp/index.js installPermissionGate) and the name is written onto the
 * request's own row afterwards (activityLog.SetMcpTools).
 *
 * Two rules that keep this from ever being the thing that breaks a request:
 *
 *   1. Writes are fire-and-forget. `log()` is never awaited by a request
 *      handler — a slow or failing log write must not add latency or cause
 *      a 500 on an otherwise-successful call.
 *   2. Retention is real. This table is written to on every call, so
 *      "keep everything forever" turns into an unbounded table fast. A
 *      background sweep purges rows past ACTIVITY_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS.

 * It does hand back the write, resolved to the row it created (or null when the
 * write failed), so a caller that needs to annotate the row it just wrote can
 * chain off it. The one caller that does is the MCP surface, which learns the
 * tool it called only after the row is already in (src/plugins/mcp.js).
